This project is focused on predicting the severity of damage to buildings caused by earthquakes. Using a dataset containing various building attributes, geographic information, and historical earthquake data, the goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the damage grade of a building after an earthquake.

## 🌟 **Project Overview**

In this project, we aim to classify the **damage grade** of buildings after an earthquake, based on features like **geographic location**, **building materials**, and other structural/non-structural attributes.

- **Target variable**: `damage_grade`
  - `1`: Minor damage 🟢
  - `2`: Moderate damage 🟡
  - `3`: Severe damage 🔴

### 🎯 **Features**:
- **Geographic identifiers**: `geo_level_1_id`, `geo_level_2_id`, `geo_level_3_id`
- **Building characteristics**: Foundation type, roof type, and age of the building.
- **Usage features**: Whether the building has secondary uses (e.g., agriculture, industry).
- **Target**: `damage_grade`
